# MedAIx

A research-use medical imaging AI platform built for TED University SENG 492 Senior Project.

MedAIx accepts medical images, validates them through a multi-gate input pipeline, routes them to the correct specialist model, runs deep ensemble inference with uncertainty quantification, generates Grad-CAM++ visual explanations, and returns a governed policy decision through a single end-to-end pipeline.

This project is for research and educational use only. Outputs are non-diagnostic and must not be used for clinical decision-making.

## What it does

- Accepts uploaded images through the web interface (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, DICOM)
- Rejects non-medical and out-of-distribution inputs before analysis
- Routes supported images to one of three active pipelines:
  - Chest X-ray — 14-label multilabel classification (DenseNet121, CheXpert)
  - Bone X-ray — Normal / Abnormal binary classification (DenseNet121, MURA)
  - Brain MRI — 4-class tumor classification: Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, Pituitary (ResNet18)
- Runs MC dropout ensemble inference with epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty quantification
- Generates Grad-CAM++ heatmaps for all three routes
- Evaluates all pipeline signals through a governed decision policy: ANSWER / REFUSE / ESCALATE / REQUEST_EVIDENCE / STOP
- Returns a structured response including input gate result, detected region and modality, selected route and model, quality check, OOD status, uncertainty metrics, explainability output, and policy decision

## Evaluation results

Chest X-ray pipeline (20-image evaluation set):
- Chest images accepted (not STOP): 20/20 — 100%
- Non-chest images rejected (STOP): 20/20 — 100%

Brain MRI model (Kaggle Brain Tumor MRI Dataset, independent test set):
- Validation accuracy: 95.3% across 4 classes (Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, Pituitary)

python3 train_bone_input_gate.py

# Medical X-ray top-level gate
python3 train_medical_xray_gate.py

# Brain MRI input gate
python3 train_brain_mri_gate.py

# Brain MRI inference model (requires Kaggle brain tumor dataset)
python3 train_brain_mri.py
```

Brain MRI training dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset

## Pipeline stages

Every image passes through the following stages in order:

1. Ingestion validation — file format, header integrity, size limits
2. Input gate — multi-gate binary classifiers (chest, bone, brain, medical xray)
3. Preprocessing — modality-aware normalization and resizing
4. Quality assessment — blur, noise, artifact, orientation checks
5. OOD detection — feature distance from reference distribution
6. Region and modality detection — conformal prediction routing (alpha = 0.1)
7. Model registry — deterministic route-to-model resolution
8. Ensemble inference — MC dropout with epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty
9. Explainability — Grad-CAM++ heatmap generation
10. Governed decision policy — multi-gate abstention policy
